This is Variegated, the blog of Alan Hohn.

I'm a Lockheed Martin Fellow with a background as a software architect,
lead, and manager. I've got a lot of experience re-architecting embedded 
systems, mostly using distributed Java, and in combining embedded and
enterprise approaches. Lately I've been doing quite a bit of work with
virtualization, DevOps and cloud technologies.

Over the past several years, I've had the opportunity to teach some courses,
both introductory and advanced. That's meant writing quite a few examples. My
role and interest also mean I frequently try out new libraries and new
approaches. My hope is that some of that material will be as useful to others
as I've occasionally found it.

I'm the author of [Hands-On Infrastructure Automation with Ansible][ansvid]
and [Hands-On DevOps with Ansible](ansdev), video courses from Packt
Publishing that teach Ansible using real-world examples. I invite you to
check them out.
