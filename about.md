This is Variegated, the blog of Alan Hohn.

I'm a software architect who primarily works with distributed Java, especially
Java EE via JBoss. I've got a lot of experience re-architecting
embedded systems and in combining embedded and enterprise approaches.

Over the past several years, I've had the opportunity to teach some courses
on Java, both introductory and advanced courses. That's meant writing quite a
few examples. My role and interest also mean I frequently try out new libraries
and new approaches. My hope is that some of that material will be as useful
to others as I've occasionally found it.

More detailed career information is available on my [LinkedIn page][li]. I'm
employed my Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training. All views on this site
are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Lockheed Martin.
