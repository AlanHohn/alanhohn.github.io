I started with DZone in November 2015 as a Zone Leader. This is
a great program they have where they work with people in the community
both to get original content and to get help in publishing articles
from blogs where the committers have an agreement with DZone for
republishing.

Since that time, I did a lot of posting directly to DZone's site.
I had intended to republish those here, but DZone is the place where
I get pretty much all my page views, so it wasn't a priority.

Since I took a new job around the first of the year, I had to shift
priorities and asked to take a hiatus from the Zone Leader program.
At the same time, I'm still intending to post articles when I can.

So long story short, I wanted to centralize the stuff I've written
to be in one place. So I did that. So there are a lot more posts on
this blog, but as should be clear from the dates, they're not new.

I write in Markdown anyway, and I use Jekyll and GitHub Pages for
the blog, so bringing them over was an automated conversion process.
They seem to look OK, but if you see something that got broken,
feel free to drop me a line.
