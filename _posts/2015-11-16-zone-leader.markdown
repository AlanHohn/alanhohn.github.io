Since this blog was new, the content has been syndicated at [DZone][dz]
through their Most Valuable Blogger (MVB) program. Most of the people
who have read what I've written have read it there, so it's been
advantageous to me, especially when I was starting as a new blogger.

Recently I was invited to join their Zone Leader program. As a result,
I am joining a number of others posting original content at DZone and
helping to syndicate the work of MVBs. It's been a pleasure getting to
know many of the other zone leaders, many of whom have impressive
resumes in software development.

As a result, I intend to shift posting over to DZone directly. So this
blog will be a little quieter. One downside is that there isn't a way 
to get an RSS feed just for my articles, though there is a [direct link][art].

I may use this blog for personal matters, or for items that don't quite
fit the format over there. I will also post a periodic list of articles
that have I written for DZone, so at least there will be some utility
to my RSS feed. For those few (ok, very few) people who subscribe directly
to this blog, I hope you'll subscribe to the [DZone feed][df], where
my articles as well as those of many other interesting folks will appear.
