As I've advised a few teams this year who are making the switch to agile, I've
found myself advocating more and more heavily for Kanban or "continuous flow"
styles. I thought I'd take some time and write down what I think are the
reasons I'm moving in that direction. Of course, Kanban is a [frequent][1]
[topic][2] on DZone. I won't waste your time by describing it, but hopefully
I can find a fresh insight or two, or at least say something stupid enough to
make people want to comment.

The first reason I want to discuss comes from how I've seen agile
done, at least on some large teams (over 50 people). As an employee
of a large organization, I've always been interested in how agile
methods work at scale, including how they interact with the broader
organization.

Large organizations tend to be very interested in managing risk, and the
primary risk in engineering (at least during development) is that whatever
we're doing will not work out the way we've planned. For this reason, a lot of
energy is expended on figuring out if everything is going the way it was
originally planned to go. Note that this isn't just a concern about costing too 
much or taking too long, although of course that's bad, but a concern that
the plan is wrong. A status report that indicates that the planned work was done
for half the cost or in half the time gets a great deal of attention, for two
main reasons. First, it raises the possibility that the work was not done to
the right standard, or that it does not do all the things it needs to do. Second,
it raises the possibility that we don't really understand the work we're doing as
well as we thought. This could mean that our estimates of the future work are
also suspect.

Of course, in practice, we generally *don't* understand the work we're doing as well
as we thought. As nice as it would be, we don't get to build the same thing more
than once in engineering. But if it were possible, the program manager would prefer to have
a well-understood, consistent approach to the work, where the line graph shows us
steadily moving upward toward completion, tracking exactly to the line that shows
our initial plan.

Agile methodologies come into this way of thinking and, at first, they appear
to disrupt it. Teams start talking about self-organization, and about embracing
change, and program managers get concerned, because they conclude that this
means that teams aren't going to be doing things the same way week after week,
and that in any case, the program is going to be changing what "completion"
means all the time, so there's no way to track progress against "completion".

But program managers are smart, and they soon get over this initial concern.
They notice that the agile teams keep performing these "sprints". At the
beginning of each one, the team plans out the work they will do during the
sprint, and at the end, they see how they did against the plan. This is catnip
to a program manager. As long as we allocate a certain amount of the overall
work to each sprint, and we keep meeting our sprint plans, they conclude, we
will be on plan for the whole program.

The mental process I'm attributing to program managers may be unconscious, but
I'm convinced that something like it must be going on, because I've witnessed
multiple agile programs where sprint goals were presented to the team ahead of
time, and daily standup meetings turned into an "encouragement" session of why
it's really important to meet the sprint goals so we can stay on track for the
overall program. And, honestly, as long as the sprint goals are reasonable, this
isn't the worst way to run the program. At least you get a regular pulse as to
whether the team is on track. It's just that I can't see any way to call this
an agile methodology just because it's agile terminology.

So where do we go from here? Well, one thing we might notice is that these sprints
are artificial deadlines. There might be value to the customer of getting certain
features sooner rather than later, but there's nothing that says we have to break
things up into fixed-length iterations in order to do continuous incremental
delivery of value. Maybe a methodology that doesn't have sprints would avoid this
particular problem.

Of course, not every team has this particular problem. If you're on a team where
sprint content is determined by the team, and the discipline of sprints helps the
team to stay focused on necessary work and maintain high productivity, then there's
no reason to change. But if you're on a team where sprints have become
counter-productive and are a source of pain to the team rather than value, then
the most agile thing to do might be to get rid of them.

In upcoming articles I'll talk to other reasons I find myself advocating for Kanban,
and hopefully illuminate what I think are some of its key features.
