This post is an excerpt from my new book, [Conversational Git][book]. The
entire book is available on-line and its source is [on GitHub][bookrepo].
It's designed to be a quick, accessible introduction for experienced developers.
I'd be delighted to hear what others think.

I recently had some close friends talk about their hesitation in adopting Git as
opposed to continuing to work with Subversion. I've used Subversion for many
years, and advocated for its use. I have since jumped wholeheartedly on the
Git bandwagon, so I wanted to find a way to tell the story of why I made the
switch and why I think so much of the open source community is now based around
Git and Git-friendly sites like GitHub.

These friends are smart people, and if they're not convinced about Git, the problem
is not them; it's that they haven't seen the right argument yet. There's so
much content out there about Git, and much of it is written at a level that's
way higher than my expertise. But in a way, that's an issue. When you're first
starting out learning something, the questions that you have are way different
from the questions an experienced person has. Once you've won that knowledge,
it's almost impossible to go back and think about what it was like when you
were first learning. That puts you in a bad position to explain to someone else
who's brand new.

Git seems particularly prone to this because it's based on some pretty complex notions
of how to think about version control. In particular, once you internalize the concept 
of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that underlies basically everything in Git, you tend
to want to explain that to new people because (a) it can help you think about how Git works;
and (b) it's cool. Unfortunately, teaching Git from a DAG perspective is IMHO the *worst*
way to teach it to new users because it suggests to them that they have to thoroughly
understand complex concepts from graph theory to use Git effectively. There's also no
question that the Git help pages use Git-specific jargon, which really interferes with
non-experts understanding what a command does.

[The book][book] adopts a style that should be accessible to new users.
It's informal , with plenty of first- and second-person references.  This is
not a "dummies" book; I'm not going to talk down to you, and I'm not going to
suggest that you shouldn't learn complex concepts about Git. But I'm going to
try to talk about how I use Git and how I see it being used effectively.

I hope the book is interesting and useful and I look forward to feedback.
